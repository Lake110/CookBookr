## UX Design

CookBookr was designed with a warm, inviting aesthetic that evokes the comfort and joy of home cooking while maintaining modern web standards and accessibility.

### Colour Scheme

The color palette was carefully chosen to create a warm, friendly atmosphere that encourages users to share their culinary creations:

#### Primary Colors
- **Cerulean (#437390)**: Used for accent colors, links, and hover states
- **Dark Cyan (#295657)**: Primary color for headers, buttons, and main UI elements
- **Burnt Sienna (#AA6056)**: Call-to-action buttons and important highlights

#### Supporting Colors
- **Eggplant (#754B6E)**: Background sections and cards
- **Brass (#C39D4D)**: Icons, borders, and subtle accents
- **Olive (#D7C974)**: Secondary sections and soft backgrounds
- **Cream (#FAF3E0)**: Main background for a warm, welcoming feel
- **Charcoal (#1C1C1C)**: Primary text for excellent readability

#### Color Psychology
The warm earth tones and muted colors were selected to:
- Create a cozy, kitchen-like atmosphere
- Ensure food photography looks appetizing against the backgrounds
- Maintain accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Evoke feelings of comfort and home cooking

### Typography

Typography choices emphasize readability and warmth:

- **Primary Font**: System fonts for optimal performance and familiarity
- **Headings**: Bold weights to create clear hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Regular weight with optimal line spacing for recipe reading
- **Recipe Instructions**: Clear, numbered lists with adequate spacing
- **Meta Information**: Smaller, muted text for cooking times and servings

### Imagery

- **Recipe Cards**: Consistent square format for visual harmony
- **Placeholder Images**: Subtle gradients when user photos aren't available
- **Food Photography**: High contrast backgrounds to make food images pop
- **Icons**: FontAwesome icons for consistent, recognizable UI elements
- **Hero Section**: Warm gradient backgrounds using the brand color palette
