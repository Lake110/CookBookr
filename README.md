## Project Overview

**CookBookr** aims to create a vibrant online community for food enthusiasts to share their culinary creations, discover new recipes, and streamline their meal planning process.

### MVP Goals (Recipe Sharing)
- User registration and authentication system
- Create, read, update, and delete recipes
- Comment system for community interaction
- User profiles for recipe management

### Planned Iterations
- **Iteration 2**: Meal Planning - Weekly calendar-style meal planning with external recipe API integration
- **Iteration 3**: Shopping & Nutrition - Automated shopping list generation and nutrition tracking

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

### 1. Register and Log In
**As a site user, I can register and log in so that I can share my own recipes.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given valid registration details, when I submit the form, then my account is created, and I am logged in.
- **AC2:** Given an existing account, when I submit correct login credentials, then I am logged in and redirected to the homepage.
- **AC3:** Given incorrect login details, when I attempt to log in, then I see an error message and remain on the login page.

### 2. Create a Recipe
**As a site user, I can create a recipe so that I can share it with others.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given I am logged in, when I submit a recipe with a title, ingredients, instructions, and optional photo, then the recipe is saved and appears in my list.
- **AC2:** Given required fields are left blank, when I attempt to submit, then I see a validation error.

### 3. View Recipes
**As a site user, I can view recipes so that I can try cooking them.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given multiple recipes exist, when I open the recipes page, then I see a list of recipes with title and summary.
- **AC2:** Given I click a recipe, when the detail page loads, then I see the full recipe including ingredients, instructions, and comments.

### 4. Comment on Recipes
**As a site user, I can comment on recipes so that I can give feedback or ask questions.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given I am logged in, when I submit a comment, then my comment appears under the recipe with my username and timestamp.
- **AC2:** Given I am not logged in, when I attempt to comment, then I am prompted to log in or register.

### 5. Edit/Delete My Recipes
**As a site user, I can edit or delete my own recipes so that I can keep them up to date.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given I am logged in and viewing my recipe, when I click "Edit" and update fields, then the recipe updates successfully.
- **AC2:** Given I am logged in and viewing my recipe, when I click "Delete," then the recipe is removed from the database.

### 6. Edit/Delete My Comments
**As a site user, I can edit or delete my own comments so that I can control what I post.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Given I am logged in and viewing my comment, when I click "Edit" and update the text, then the updated comment is displayed.
- **AC2:** Given I am logged in and viewing my comment, when I click "Delete," then the comment is removed from the recipe page.

## Planned Models & Database Design

### Core Models (MVP)
- **User**: Django's built-in User model with custom profile extension
- **Recipe**: Main recipe model with title, description, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, servings
- **Comment**: User comments on recipes with timestamp and content
- **Category**: Recipe categories (cuisine types, dietary preferences)

### Model Relationships
- User ‚Üí Recipe (One-to-Many: One user can create many recipes)
- User ‚Üí Comment (One-to-Many: One user can make many comments)  
- Recipe ‚Üí Comment (One-to-Many: One recipe can have many comments)
- Recipe ‚Üí Category (Many-to-Many: Recipes can belong to multiple categories)

### Future Models (Later Iterations)
- **MealPlan**: Weekly meal planning structure
- **ShoppingList**: Generated shopping lists from meal plans
- **MealPlanItem**: Junction table for meal plan recipes
- **Nutrition**: Nutritional information for recipes
