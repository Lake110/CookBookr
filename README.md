## Project Overview

CookBookr is a full-stack Django web application for sharing and discovering recipes, featuring user authentication, commenting, notifications, and responsive design.

---

## UX & Design

### Colour Scheme

The color palette was carefully chosen to create a warm, friendly atmosphere that encourages users to share their culinary creations:

#### Primary Colors
- **Bootstrap Primary (#0D6EFD)**: Used for buttons, links, and primary UI elements
- **Bootstrap Success (#198754)**: Used for positive actions and confirmations
- **Bootstrap Warning (#FFC107)**: Used for alerts and important notices
- **Bootstrap Danger (#DC3545)**: Used for delete actions and error states

#### Supporting Colors
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Main background for clean, readable interface
- **Light Gray (#F8F9FA)**: Card backgrounds and subtle sections
- **Dark Gray (#212529)**: Primary text for excellent readability
- **Medium Gray (#6C757D)**: Secondary text and meta information

#### Color Psychology
The clean, modern color scheme was selected to:
- Ensure excellent readability and accessibility
- Create a professional, trustworthy appearance
- Allow food photography to be the visual focus
- Maintain consistency with modern web design standards

### Typography

Typography choices emphasize readability and modern design:

- **Primary Font**: System font stack for optimal performance
- **Headings**: Bold weights (font-weight: 600-700) for clear hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Regular weight (font-weight: 400) with 1.5 line height
- **Recipe Instructions**: Clear, structured lists with adequate spacing
- **Meta Information**: Smaller text (0.9rem) for cooking times and author info

### Imagery

- **Recipe Images**: Cloudinary-hosted images with responsive sizing
- **Placeholder Images**: Clean default images when user photos aren't available
- **Icons**: FontAwesome icons for consistent, recognizable UI elements
- **Layout**: Card-based design for easy scanning and visual organization

---

### Wireframes

Visual design wireframes for CookBookr across devices:

#### Mobile Design (320px - 768px)
![Phone Wireframe](<docs/Readme/images/Phone Design.jpg>)
*Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly buttons and collapsible navigation*

#### Tablet Design (768px - 1024px)
![Tablet Wireframe](<docs/Readme/images/Tablet Design.jpg>)
*Optimized for tablet viewing with improved layout spacing*

#### Desktop Design (1024px+)
![PC Wireframe](<docs/Readme/images/PC design.jpg>)
*Full desktop experience with expanded navigation and content areas*

**Design Decisions:**
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Card-based layout for easy recipe browsing
- Consistent navigation across all screen sizes
- Bootstrap framework for responsive grid system

### Accessibility & WCAG Compliance

Accessibility is a core part of CookBookr's design and development:
- All pages use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer) for clear structure.
- Interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) include ARIA labels and roles where needed.
- Color contrast and font sizes were checked using Lighthouse tools to ensure readability for all users.
- Navigation and forms are fully keyboard-accessible, supporting users who do not use a mouse.
- Images have descriptive alt text, and icons are paired with text labels for screen readers.
- Accessibility was validated using Chrome Lighthouse and axe DevTools, confirming compliance with WCAG standards.
