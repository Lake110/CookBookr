## UX Design

CookBookr was designed with a warm, inviting aesthetic that evokes the comfort and joy of home cooking while maintaining modern web standards and accessibility.

### Colour Scheme

The color palette was carefully chosen to create a warm, friendly atmosphere that encourages users to share their culinary creations:

#### Primary Colors
- **Bootstrap Primary (#0D6EFD)**: Used for buttons, links, and primary UI elements
- **Bootstrap Success (#198754)**: Used for positive actions and confirmations
- **Bootstrap Warning (#FFC107)**: Used for alerts and important notices
- **Bootstrap Danger (#DC3545)**: Used for delete actions and error states

#### Supporting Colors
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: Main background for clean, readable interface
- **Light Gray (#F8F9FA)**: Card backgrounds and subtle sections
- **Dark Gray (#212529)**: Primary text for excellent readability
- **Medium Gray (#6C757D)**: Secondary text and meta information

#### Color Psychology
The clean, modern color scheme was selected to:
- Ensure excellent readability and accessibility
- Create a professional, trustworthy appearance
- Allow food photography to be the visual focus
- Maintain consistency with modern web design standards

### Typography

Typography choices emphasize readability and modern design:

- **Primary Font**: System font stack for optimal performance
- **Headings**: Bold weights (font-weight: 600-700) for clear hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Regular weight (font-weight: 400) with 1.5 line height
- **Recipe Instructions**: Clear, structured lists with adequate spacing
- **Meta Information**: Smaller text (0.9rem) for cooking times and author info

### Imagery

- **Recipe Images**: Cloudinary-hosted images with responsive sizing
- **Placeholder Images**: Clean default images when user photos aren't available
- **Icons**: FontAwesome icons for consistent, recognizable UI elements
- **Layout**: Card-based design for easy scanning and visual organization

A collapsible sidebar would appear on the right side of the homepage, providing users with quick access to their current meal plan:

**Sidebar Structure:**
- **Compact week view** showing the next 7 days in a vertical layout
- **Today's meals** highlighted with a distinctive border or background color
- **Meal thumbnails** showing small recipe images for planned meals
- **Quick actions** including "View Full Planner" and "Edit Today's Meals"
- **Grocery reminder** notification if shopping list needs attention

**Sidebar Functionality:**
- **Auto-collapse** on mobile devices to save screen space
- **Persistent across pages** so users can always see their meal plan
- **Click-through navigation** to detailed recipe pages
- **Drag-and-drop integration** allowing users to add featured recipes directly to meal slots
- **Status indicators** showing meal prep reminders and cooking times

**Homepage Integration Benefits:**
- **Quick meal reference** without navigating away from main content
- **Seamless recipe discovery** by dragging homepage recipes into the meal plan
- **Daily meal reminders** keeping users engaged with their planning
- **Cross-feature connectivity** linking recipe browsing with meal planning
- **Reduced navigation friction** for frequent meal plan users

**Responsive Behavior:**
- **Desktop view** (1200px+): Full sidebar always visible alongside main content

- **Mobile view** (<768px): Bottom-anchored floating action button that expands to show meal plan
- **Touch optimization** with larger tap targets and swipe gestures for navigation

This integrated approach transforms the homepage from a simple recipe browser into a comprehensive meal planning dashboard, encouraging daily engagement and making meal planning a central part of the user experience rather than a separate feature.

*CookBookr represents a comprehensive full-stack web application built with Django, demonstrating modern web development practices, responsive design, and cloud deployment capabilities.*

## Accessibility & WCAG Compliance

Accessibility is a core part of CookBookr's design and development:
- All pages use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer) for clear structure.
- Interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) include ARIA labels and roles where needed.
- Color contrast and font sizes were checked using WCAG 2.1 AA tools to ensure readability for all users.
- Navigation and forms are fully keyboard-accessible, supporting users who do not use a mouse.
- Images have descriptive alt text, and icons are paired with text labels for screen readers.
- Accessibility was validated using Chrome Lighthouse and axe DevTools, confirming compliance with WCAG standards.

## Real-Time Notifications

Real-time notifications are not currently implemented. User feedback is provided via Django messages (Bootstrap alerts) for actions such as recipe creation, comment posting, and authentication. Future plans include adding WebSocket-based notifications for collaborative features and live updates.

## Automated Testing & Coverage

Automated testing is performed using Django's test framework:
- Unit tests cover models, views, and forms for core features (recipe CRUD, authentication, meal planning).
- Integration tests validate user flows such as registration, login, recipe creation, and meal plan assignment.
- Coverage metrics: Over 80% of backend code is covered by automated tests (see coverage report in `/docs/Readme/coverage.png`).
- Manual testing procedures are documented above for UI and UX validation.

### Copilot-Generated Tests & Reflection

GitHub Copilot was used to generate initial Django unit tests for models and views. These tests were manually reviewed, adjusted for accuracy, and expanded to cover edge cases. Copilot accelerated boilerplate test creation and helped identify missing scenarios. Human oversight ensured all tests matched business logic and requirements.

Copilot's role in test creation:
- Generated test skeletons for models, forms, and views
- Suggested assertions and test data for common cases
- Helped maintain consistent test structure and naming
- Enabled rapid iteration and increased test coverage

All Copilot-generated tests were reviewed and refined for reliability and relevance to project goals.

## Lighthouse Audit Results

CookBookr was tested using Google Lighthouse across multiple key pages (homepage, add recipe, all recipes):

- **Performance:** 98-100
- **Accessibility:** 93-94
- **Best Practices:** 96
- **SEO:** 100

**Highlights:**
- Pages load quickly with minimal blocking time and excellent speed index.
- Accessibility scores are high, with sequential heading order and label improvements implemented.
- All pages pass SEO checks, including valid structured data and meta tags.
- Best practices are followed for security, XSS protection, and HTTPS.

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Minor accessibility warnings (e.g., color contrast, heading order) are actively addressed in templates.
- Lighthouse audits are run regularly to maintain high scores and compliance.
